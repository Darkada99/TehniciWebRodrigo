                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <font color="grey">Kemper was born in Burbank, California, to Clarnell Stage and Edmund Emil
                            Kemper Jr. He was very intelligent with an IQ of 136, however, he displayed sociopathic
                            behavior from a young age: he tortured and killed animals, acted out bizarre sexual rituals
                            with his sisters' dolls and once said that, in order to kiss a teacher he had a crush on, he
                            would have to kill her. Worsening the situation was Kemper's mother, who constantly berated
                            and humiliated her son and often made him sleep in a locked basement due to a fear that he
                            would molest his sisters. Kemper's mother Clarnell apparently suffered from Borderline
                            Personality Disorder which resulted in her rages and abuse against her son.

                            <br> On August 27, 1964, Kemper shot his grandmother while she sat at the kitchen table
                            putting the finishing touches on her latest children's book. When his grandfather came home
                            from grocery shopping, Kemper shot him as well. Then he called his mother, who urged him to
                            call the police. When questioned, he said that he "just wanted to see what it felt like to
                            kill Grandma", and that he killed his grandfather because he knew he would be angry at him
                            for what he had done to his grandmother. Kemper was just 15 at the time.

                            <br>Kemper was committed to Atascadero State Hospital where he befriended his psychologist
                            and even became his assistant. He was intelligent enough to gain the trust of the doctor to
                            the extent of being allowed access to prisoners' tests. With the knowledge he gained from
                            his "apprenticeship" he eventually was able to impress his doctor at the hospital enough to
                            let him go.

                            <br> He was released into his mother's care in Santa Cruz, California, against the wishes of
                            several doctors at the hospital. Kemper later demonstrated further to the psychologists that
                            he was wellâ€”and not only managed to convince the doctors he was reformed, but to have his
                            juvenile records sealed forever as well.

                    </h1>
                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <font color="grey">Kemper worked a series of odd jobs before securing work with the State of
                            California's Department of Public Works/Division of Highways in District 4 (now known as
                            Department of Transportation or Caltrans). By that time, his height had reached 6 feet, 9
                            inches, and he weighed more than 300 pounds (136 kg).

                            <br> Between May 1972 and February 1973, Kemper embarked on a spree of murders, picking up
                            female students hitchhiking, taking them to isolated rural areas and killing them. He would
                            stab, shoot or smother the victims and afterwards take the bodies back to his apartment
                            where he would have sex with them and then dissect them.

                            <br>He would often dump the bodies in ravines or bury them in fields, although on one
                            occasion he buried the severed head of a 15-year-old girl in his mother's garden as a kind
                            of sick joke, later remarking that his mother "always wanted people to look up to her."

                            <br> He killed six college girls (including two students from UC Santa Cruz, where his
                            mother worked, and one from Cabrillo College). He would often go hunting for victims after
                            arguing with his mother.

                            <br>In April 1973, Kemper battered his mother to death with a pick hammer while she slept.
                            He decapitated her, raped her headless body and used her head as a dartboard, after putting
                            her vocal cords in the garbage disposal, but the machine could not break the tough tissue
                            down and regurgitated it back into the sink. "That seemed appropriate," Ed said after his
                            arrest, "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years."

                            <br>His murderous urges not yet satiated, he then invited his mother's best friend over and
                            killed her too, by strangulation. He then drove eastward, but when no word of his crimes hit
                            the radio airwaves he became discouraged, stopped the car, called the police and confessed
                            to being the Co-ed Killer.

                            <br>He told them what he had done and waited for them to pick him up, seemingly unashamed as
                            he confessed to necrophilia and cannibalism. At his trial he pleaded insanity, but he was
                            found guilty of eight counts of murder. He asked for the death penalty, but with capital
                            punishment suspended at that time, he instead received life imprisonment.

                            <br>At the time of Kemper's murder spree in Santa Cruz, another serial killer named Herbert
                            Mullin was also active, earning the small California town the title of "Murder Capital Of
                            The World." And, adding to the college town's infamy was the fact that these multiple
                            murders were preceded three years earlier by multiple murders committed by John Linley
                            Frazier.

                            <br>In a manner similar to the Charles Manson murders, Frazier murdered a Santa Cruz family
                            of five, eye surgeon Victor Ohta and family. A reference was made to this in the film "The
                            Lost Boys", which was shot in Santa Cruz, but called Santa Carla, where they repeatedly call
                            the town the "Murder Capital of the World." Kemper and Mullin were briefly held in adjoining
                            cells, with the former angrily accusing the latter of stealing his body-dumping sites.

                            <br>Edmund Kemper remains among the general prison population and is incarcerated at
                            Vacaville State Prison.
