                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <font color="grey">Born to an unmarried 16-year-old named Kathleen Maddox, in Cincinnati General Hospital, Ohio, Manson was first dubbed "no name Maddox." Within weeks, he was Charles Milles Maddox. For a period after his birth, his mother was married to a laborer named William Manson, whose last name the boy was given. The boy's biological father appears to have been a "Colonel Scott", against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a bastardy suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937. Possibly, the boy never really knew him.

                            <br> Several statements in Manson's 1951 case file from the seven months he would later spend at the National Training School for Boys in Washington, D.C., allude to the possibility that "Colonel Scott" was African American. These include the first two sentences of his family background section, which read: "Father: unknown. He is alleged to have been a colored cook by the name of Scott, with whom the boy's mother had been promiscuous at the time of pregnancy." When asked about these official records by attorney Vincent Bugliosi in 1971, Manson emphatically denied that his biological father had African American ancestry.



                            <br>In the quasi-autobiography, Manson in His Own Words, Colonel Scott is said to have been "a young drugstore cowboy ... a transient laborer working on a nearby dam project." It is not clear what "nearby" means. The description is in a paragraph that indicates Kathleen Maddox gave birth to Manson "while living in Cincinnati," after she had run away from her own home, in Ashland, Kentucky.



                            <br> Manson's mother was allegedly a heavy drinker. According to a family member, she once sold her son for a pitcher of beer to a childless waitress, from whom his uncle retrieved him some days later. When Manson's mother and her brother were sentenced to five years imprisonment for robbing a Charleston, West Virginia, service station in 1939, Manson was placed in the home of an aunt and uncle in McMechen, West Virginia. Upon her 1942 parole, Kathleen retrieved her son and lived with him in run-down hotel rooms. Manson himself later characterized her physical embrace of him on the day she returned from prison as his sole happy childhood memory.

                            <br>In 1947, Kathleen Maddox tried to have her son placed in a foster home but failed because no such home was available. The court placed Manson in Gibault School for Boys, in Terre Haute, Indiana. After 10 months, he fled from there to his mother, who rejected him.

                    <br>

                    <p>
                        <font color="grey">Kemper worked a series of odd jobs before securing work with the State of
                            California's Department of Public Works/Division of Highways in District 4 (now known as
                            Department of Transportation or Caltrans). By that time, his height had reached 6 feet, 9
                            inches, and he weighed more than 300 pounds (136 kg).

                            <br> Between May 1972 and February 1973, Kemper embarked on a spree of murders, picking up
                            female students hitchhiking, taking them to isolated rural areas and killing them. He would
                            stab, shoot or smother the victims and afterwards take the bodies back to his apartment
                            where he would have sex with them and then dissect them.

                            <br>He would often dump the bodies in ravines or bury them in fields, although on one
                            occasion he buried the severed head of a 15-year-old girl in his mother's garden as a kind
                            of sick joke, later remarking that his mother "always wanted people to look up to her."

                            <br> He killed six college girls (including two students from UC Santa Cruz, where his
                            mother worked, and one from Cabrillo College). He would often go hunting for victims after
                            arguing with his mother.

                            <br>In April 1973, Kemper battered his mother to death with a pick hammer while she slept.
                            He decapitated her, raped her headless body and used her head as a dartboard, after putting
                            her vocal cords in the garbage disposal, but the machine could not break the tough tissue
                            down and regurgitated it back into the sink. "That seemed appropriate," Ed said after his
                            arrest, "as much as she'd bitched and screamed and yelled at me over so many years."

                            <br>His murderous urges not yet satiated, he then invited his mother's best friend over and
                            killed her too, by strangulation. He then drove eastward, but when no word of his crimes hit
                            the radio airwaves he became discouraged, stopped the car, called the police and confessed
                            to being the Co-ed Killer.

                            <br>He told them what he had done and waited for them to pick him up, seemingly unashamed as
                            he confessed to necrophilia and cannibalism. At his trial he pleaded insanity, but he was
                            found guilty of eight counts of murder. He asked for the death penalty, but with capital
                            punishment suspended at that time, he instead received life imprisonment.

                            <br>At the time of Kemper's murder spree in Santa Cruz, another serial killer named Herbert
                            Mullin was also active, earning the small California town the title of "Murder Capital Of
                            The World." And, adding to the college town's infamy was the fact that these multiple
                            murders were preceded three years earlier by multiple murders committed by John Linley
                            Frazier.

                            <br>In a manner similar to the Charles Manson murders, Frazier murdered a Santa Cruz family
                            of five, eye surgeon Victor Ohta and family. A reference was made to this in the film "The
                            Lost Boys", which was shot in Santa Cruz, but called Santa Carla, where they repeatedly call
                            the town the "Murder Capital of the World." Kemper and Mullin were briefly held in adjoining
                            cells, with the former angrily accusing the latter of stealing his body-dumping sites.

                            <br>Edmund Kemper remains among the general prison population and is incarcerated at
                            Vacaville State Prison.
